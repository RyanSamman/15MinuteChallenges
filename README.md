# Why 15 Minute Challenges?
I see a lot of problems with the way I code, such as:
- I'm usually not motivated enough to finish what I start
- I code too slowly
- I get distracted easily
- I tend to try making my code perfect, even though that isn't the goal

Therefore I came up with the idea to code up one idea within only 15 minutes, no matter what the end result is.

Some goals I hope to achieve with this:
- Finish a bunch of ideas I had in my mind
- Reinforce what I learn on my spare time
- Form Good Habits
