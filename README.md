# Why 15 Minute Challenges?
I see a lot of problems with the way I code, such as:
- I'm usually not motivated enough to finish what I start
- I code too slowly
- I get distracted easily
- I tend to try making my code perfect, even though that isn't the goal

Therefore I came up with the idea to code up one idea within only 15 minutes, no matter what the end result is.

Some goals I hope to achieve with this:
- Finish a bunch of ideas I had in my mind
- Reinforce what I learn on my spare time
- Form Good Habits

# First 15 Minute Challenge
I always wondered if I had any patterns in the messages I send on WhatsApp. After visualizing the the most common words mentioned in my messages, I realize the answer is yes.

### Note:
You can export your WhatsApp chat and download it as a text file, and that is what I did before starting this challenge.

## Goals: 
✅ Completed All Goals
- Obtain all of my text from the group chat
- Remove unwanted text
- Visualize the Text and Place it in this file
- Bonus: Add flexibility between people

# Second 15 Minute Challenge

Standard Bit Manipulation - With a Twist.

A sane person would perform bit manipulation with Bitwise Operators:
```py
# Logical AND
0b0011 & 0b0101 # 0b0001 

# Logical OR
0b0011 & 0b0101 # 0b0111

# Logical XOR
0b0011 ^ 0b0101 # 0b0110

# Logical NOT
0b0011 ^ 0b1111 # 0b1100 (Simulated via XOR)
``` 

However, It seems I wasn't quite sane when I thought of this challenge. I decided to use x64 Assembly to perform the bit operations, and display the result using C++

## Goals: 
✅ Completed Main Goals
- Create functions using Assembly
- Print results using C++
- AND Function
- OR Function
- NOT Function
- XOR Function
- Display the differences
  
❌ Failed Bonus Goals
- Bonus:
- Shift Logical Left & Right
- Rotate shift Left & Right

Apparently speaking while programming is very hard. I overestimated how much I could get done in 15 minutes while explaining what I was doing, and wasn't able to achieve the bonus goal.
