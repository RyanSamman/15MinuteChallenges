# Why 15 Minute Challenges?
I see a lot of problems with the way I code, such as:
- Not motivated enough
- I Code too Slowly
- I tend to try making my code perfect even though that isn't the goal

Therefore I came up with the idea to get them done within only 15 minutes, to simulate being in an actual exam environment.

Some goals I hope to achieve with this:
- Finish a bunch of ideas I had in my mind
- Form good habits
- Reinforce what I learn
